# spotifyBarRaceChart

App that track you spotify data can only access a certain time frame. This means all-time ranking are often inaccurate or downright omitting important artists from your past. The solution is to download yourself your extended streaming history from the spotify website under the "privacy" tab.  
However, i did not find free, easy to access options to automatically parse those files. I did it myself, and added a fun "bar race chart" to visualise your top ranking artists/songs/albums over time

Here is a quick preview of how it works - https://youtu.be/LGEChTJqsXs
The app is up on watchitornot.streamlit.app
